## Projects Using Concur
- [Unison Code Explorer](http://unison.readvar.com) is built with concur-replica. [Source](https://github.com/seagreen/unison-code-explorer).
- [Scribble-Battleships](https://github.com/jonathanlking/scribble-battleships) is a multi party Battleships game written in PureScript-Concur using [Scribble protocol](http://www.scribble.org/) and websockets for communication. The paper [Multiparty Session Type-safe Web Development with Static Linearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01287) goes along with it.
- [TopHat - Task Oriented Programming](https://github.com/timjs/tophat-haskell). TopHat is a formalisation of Task Oriented Programming as described in the [tophat paper](https://github.com/timjs/tophat/blob/ppdp2019/main.pdf). This is the Haskell implementation of the language by the author of the paper and uses Concur.
- [Metajelo -  A METAdata package for Journals to support External Linked Objects](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/metajelo) by the [Labor Dynamics Institute at Cornell](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute). The [UI editor for Metajelo](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/metajelo-ui) is built using Purescript-concur.
- [purescript-concur-adventure](https://github.com/bbarker/purescript-concur-adventure) - Choose-your-own adventure demo using PureScript-Concur. 
  Also makes use of GitHub Actions [with Nix](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-nix) to build and deploy a live demo to GitHub pages.
- [The Round Table](https://theroundtable.fun/) is an online implementation of the game [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon). It is built using Concur-replica. [Source](https://github.com/yunze-chia/the-round-table).
- [Lunarflow](https://lunarcast.github.io/lunarflow/) is a Lambda Calculus Visualiser built with Purescript and Concur. [Source](https://github.com/lunarcast/lunarflow).
